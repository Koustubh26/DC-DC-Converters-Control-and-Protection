# Cascade Control and Protection Circuit Simulation for DC-DC Converters



This project demonstrates the \*\*design and simulation of cascade control and protection circuits\*\* for basic \*\*DC-DC converters\*\* using \*\*PLECS\*\*.  

The converters studied include \*\*buck, boost, and buck-boost topologies\*\*.





ðŸ“Œ Project Objective



* Design Mathematical models
* Design stable and fast cascade control
* Design Soft start logic with
* Design Overcurrent and Overvoltage logic



ðŸš€Â Design Steps



* Deriving the mathematical models of the DC-DC Converters in Plecs
* Perform Small Signal Analysis for the Current and Voltage loops in Plecs
* Export the Bode plots
* Use the Bode plots with the PID Tuner of MATLAB to get the required Gains and Time Constants
* Verify the working of closed loop cascade control
* Add Protection logic to the closed loop model
* Verify the working of the protection logics by adding faults
