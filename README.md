# Cascade Control and Protection Circuit Simulation for DC-DC Converters



This project demonstrates the **Design and Simulation of Cascade Control and Protection Circuits** for basic **DC-DC Converters** using **PLECS**.  

The converters studied include **Buck, Boost, and Buck-Boost topologies**.





ðŸ“Œ Project Objective



* Design Mathematical models
* Design stable and fast cascade control
* Design Soft start logic
* Design Overcurrent and Overvoltage Protection logic



ðŸš€Â Design Steps



* Deriving the mathematical models of the DC-DC Converters in Plecs
* Perform Small Signal Analysis for the Current and Voltage loops in Plecs
* Export the Bode plots
* Use the Bode plots with the PID Tuner of MATLAB to get the required Gains and Time Constants
* Verify the working of closed loop cascade control
* Add Protection logic to the closed loop model
* Verify the working of the protection logics by adding faults
