# DC-DC-Converters-Control-and-Protection
The project is about designing closed loop cascade control for DC-DC converters and their protection logic in PLECS.

The project includes a cascade control for the basic DC-DC converters which is designed in PLECS. Along with this some protection features are also simulated for a practical design.
Protection features such as Soft start, Overcurrent Protection and Overvoltage protection are added to operate the converters safely without exceeding their current and voltage limits.
